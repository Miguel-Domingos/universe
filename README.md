# Important None

1 - **this website contain feactures that does not work in some browser**

- view-transition: this feacture is not Baseline (stable) because it does not work in some of the most widely-used browsers, such as safari and firefox

2 - **Black screen**

- **Unfortunately. For some reason that I don't know, some devices, such as old and some new cell phones, are unable to render the content. If you see a black screen for a long time, it means your devices still can't render and maybe I'm trying to solve it.**
